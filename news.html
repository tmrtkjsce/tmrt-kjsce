                          It is our pleasure to announce that TMRT successfully registered for SAUVC 2018. As per the competition guidelines TMRT can send an eight member team to Singapore. The competition is held from 9th March - 12th March, 2018 and the deadline for video submission is 2nd March 2018.
                        Those who did not make it to the final eight member team should not be disheartened as you all are an integral part of the team and we still need you. The future prospects for all of us are bright because we are in talks with Indian Navy and National Institute of Oceanography to allow us to work on their projects. We are optimistic about the development and you all will be notified about the status soon.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p class = "teamInfo col-sm-4"> The software team is responsible for guidance, navigation and control of the AUV. Navigation is carried out using visual feedback and Image Processing(IP) to tackle problems like image distortion underwater and identify objects underwater based on color and contour (shape detection). An autonomous vehicle must be capable of sequencing and scheduling of tasks and thus our software team has a Mission Planning module which prioritizes tasks. Our AUV uses multiple sensors to interact with the surroundings and we need to calibrate the sensors, validate our codes and filter sensor data- we do simulation on Gazebo and ROS to save time and improve quickly.</p>
